This is a cool example of tower defense. To start type "python Run.py"
You will also need pygame(http://pythongaming.com/pygame/downloads.html) and PyQt4(https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).
To install them type "pip install 'root'"(where 'root' is the folder with these downloaded files)

Rules:
1)GameDev is always right
2)No bugs, only features
3)Only 1 menu may be opened(magic/tower)
4)Press RMB to cancel whatever you want
